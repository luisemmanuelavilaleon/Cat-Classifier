# Cat Classifier

The **Cat Classifier** project is an image classification system that utilizes deep learning to identify cat images. The project is developed in Python using the PyTorch library and is implemented using the Streamlit framework for the user interface.

## Project Structure

The project has the following folder structure:

- `src/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks used for downloading images, performing preprocessing, and training the PyTorch model.
- `metrics/`: Stores model evaluation metrics to be used in the `app.py` application.
- `img_example/`: Contains sample images that can be used to demonstrate the model's functionality.
